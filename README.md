This is a final-year group project between five group members. Roles were assigned in areas of research, coding and testing. I contributed mostly to the testing and research. 

This is a flutter application for real estate. The application will concentrate on two target markets: regular users who are interested in browsing homes and real estate investors (also known as property investors). This software simulates a real estate firm called Happy Properties, the properties they have available for sale, and the real estate investment services they offer (to the extent supported by the software) to customers who have an account with them for real estate investments.

Regular users will be able to search and browse houses, utilise financial calculators, and use a map that will show where homes are located.

Real estate investors will be able to view the properties in their portfolio, as well as the profit and loss each property generates. They will also be able to edit their profile, view alerts from their property managers, view their favourite properties, view the financial report they receive from the real estate company they work with at the end of the month, and use other features available to regular users.

Simulated data will be used by the programme. utilised technologies User authentication: Firebase Utilising the Google Maps API Firebase, the database
